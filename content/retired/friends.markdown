# Friend Tracker

Help keep track of friends and remind when to send a message

## Goals

- Use existing formats when possible, eg VCARD to store data in OSX's address book/icloud/google/etc
- Use 'last contacted' type field to make it easy to report when it has been a while since you've last contacted that person
