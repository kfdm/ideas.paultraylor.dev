For managing some of my worklogs, would like to build my own extension for VSCode to add assorted shortcuts. Similar to the existing `vscode-hugo`, I would like commands to create new posts, but also some other shortcusts.

- Search by tag in frontmatter
- Rename page and automatically add in `alias` to frontmatter
