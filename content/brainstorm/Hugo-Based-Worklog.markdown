Build a worklog that works how my mind works. Have a few brainstorms for ideas

# Caldav Based

- Use VEVENT for main worklog
- Markdown as description
- **pin** single calendar for Worklog, but support showing other calendars/todos with default [eventkit]
- Would need a separate component to publish to webpage. Consider a caldav -> web bridge

# Hugo Based

- Already supports generating webpage
- archetypes for daily, weekly, monthly worklogs and summaries
- Could be part of a larger information management system
