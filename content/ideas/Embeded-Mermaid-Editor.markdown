While editing a [markdown] document on an ipad editor, it would be useful to be able to open up a [mermaidjs] codeblock in its own editor. Should be able to

````
```mermaid
graph LR
    A ---> B
```
````

Selecting this would load the same code into a Mermaid editor that would give you a custom view to edit it and then saving it would update the copy in the original document
